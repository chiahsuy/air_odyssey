The project aims to assist the passengers to have more information about their flight status when their flight gets delayed or even canceled and they may be able to make better decisions based on the information. The project built several machine learning models to predict (1) whether a flight would be canceled and what is the likelihood, (2) whether a flight would be delayed and how long the delay would be. To predict cancellation, the project uses both anomaly detection and RandomForest classification. To predict delay, the project uses
